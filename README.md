> Type-safe, lossless round-trip conversion between OOXML packages (`.docx`, `.pptx`, `.xlsx`) and a faithful JSON model, built on [Zod 4](https://zod.dev) codecs.

An OOXML file is a ZIP of parts (an OPC "package"): `[Content_Types].xml`, relationships, XML content, and binary parts. `ooxml.js` decodes the whole package to faithful JSON and encodes it back part-for-part.

## Why

Semantic typed models are lossy and one-directional: they cannot round-trip. True round-trip needs every part, relationship, and binary byte-for-byte at the content level. `ooxml.js` provides that lossless foundation, with typed per-format readers and writers on top — each available both as `document-schema.js`'s tree-form `DocumentPackage` and as the flat, content-level shape that tree decomposes.

## Getting started

Requires Node.js `>=20` and pnpm `11.6.0` (pinned via `packageManager` in `package.json`).

```sh
pnpm install
```

Install as a dependency in another project:

```sh
pnpm add ooxml.js
# or
npm install ooxml.js
```

## Compatibility

Worker-isomorphic: runtime `src/` uses no Node-only APIs (no `node:*` imports, no bare Node builtins, no `Buffer` global), so the published package runs in Cloudflare Workers, Deno Deploy, browser bundlers, or any ES2024+ host — not just Node. This is enforced statically by an `eslint` guard (`no-restricted-imports`/`no-restricted-globals` in `eslint.config.ts`) that rejects any Node-only import in `src/`, and dynamically by the `workerd` test suite (`pnpm test:workers`) that exercises the xlsx decode path, and the `DocumentPackage` assembly and write path on top of it, inside a Cloudflare Workers isolate on every CI run. The `engines.node >= 20` pin is the development and CI floor, not a runtime constraint on consumers.

## Usage

```ts
import { decodePackage, encodePackage } from 'ooxml.js';

// .docx / .pptx / .xlsx bytes -> faithful JSON Package
const pkg = decodePackage(new Uint8Array(await file.arrayBuffer()));

// ...inspect or modify pkg.parts...

// Package -> bytes (content-identical to the original)
const bytes = encodePackage(pkg);
```

The core is a Zod 4 codec, so both directions are schema-validated:

```ts
import { z } from 'zod';
import { packageCodec } from 'ooxml.js';

const pkg = z.decode(packageCodec, bytes);
const out = z.encode(packageCodec, pkg);
```

### Typed readers and writers

Above the lossless core sit typed readers that resolve a format's own cascades — the docx style cascade, pptx's placeholder → layout → master → theme inheritance, xlsx's style-index → number-format classification — so order, styling, and geometry come through, not just flattened text. Each format has two entry points onto the same read: one producing `document-schema.js`'s tree-form `DocumentPackage`, one producing the flat, content-level shape that tree decomposes.

| Format | `DocumentPackage` (primary) | Flat, content-level |
| --- | --- | --- |
| docx | `readDocx` / `buildDocxPackage` | `readDocxContent` / `buildDocxPackageFromContent` |
| pptx | `readPptx` (read-only) | `readPptxContent` (read-only) |
| xlsx | `readXlsx` / `buildXlsxPackage` | `readXlsxContent` / `buildXlsxPackageFromContent` |

`readXlsxWorkbook` sits outside the table: a separate lossy, cell-values-only reading view (sheet names, references, resolved values, formulas, merged ranges, defined names) with no write side.

#### The `DocumentPackage` API

`readDocx`/`readPptx`/`readXlsx` decompose what they read into the tree `document-schema.js` defines — one group per top-level container, headings and lists nested inside the section they belong to, block-scoped constructs promoted to the region they span, repeated formatting factored into a package-level styles table. `buildDocxPackage`/`buildXlsxPackage` take one back the other way:

```ts
import { buildDocxPackage, decodePackage, encodePackage, readDocx } from 'ooxml.js';

const document = readDocx(decodePackage(bytes)); // DocumentPackage, kind: 'wordprocessing'
// document.children is one section group per section, the section's page geometry on the group's own
// node. Inside it, a heading paragraph opens a group holding the blocks beneath it, a list paragraph
// opens its own, and a table stays a leaf — decomposition groups a container's block flow, it never
// descends into a table's cells.
const out = encodePackage(buildDocxPackage(document)); // a complete docx, built from scratch
```

Readers mint the styles table (`assemblePackage`, i.e. `decompose` plus the frequency pass) because a reader is where a package first comes into existence. Writers materialise every ref back into direct properties (`flattenPackage`) before handing the content to the format writer, so a minted package, a hand-built one with no table at all, and a re-minted one all write out identically. Both transforms — and `decompose`/`factorStyles` for a caller composing its own boundary — are re-exported from this package, so consuming what these readers return takes no second dependency.

#### The flat, content-level API

The `Content`-suffixed functions are what the tree-form ones wrap, exported in their own right for a caller driving a pipeline stage by stage (`documents.js`'s conversion engine does exactly this) or needing what the tree has no spelling for. Routing through the tree costs no fidelity of its own: `buildDocxPackage(readDocx(pkg))` builds the identical `Package` `buildDocxPackageFromContent(readDocxContent(pkg))` does, and flattening a tree reproduces exactly the content its content-level reader returns — both pinned in `src/typed/document-package.test.ts`.

```ts
import { buildXlsxPackageFromContent, decodePackage, readXlsxContent } from 'ooxml.js';

const content = readXlsxContent(decodePackage(bytes)); // ContentDocument, kind: 'spreadsheet'
const pkg = buildXlsxPackageFromContent(content); // a fresh Package built from scratch, not a write-back into `pkg`
```

`readDocxContent` is the only reader in this package that returns a docx's comments, footnotes, header/footer text, and `word/numbering.xml` definitions: those sit on `DocxDocument` outside its `sections`, which is exactly the part of it `ContentDocument` — and therefore the tree — has no place for. They do not survive `buildDocxPackageFromContent` either (it writes none of those parts), so this is about which reader returns them, not about which pair round-trips them.

#### Fidelity constructs

Both docx readers read the block-scoped fidelity constructs — structured document tags, fields, bookmarks, and tracked changes. In the flat form they are `document-schema.js` construct-boundary markers bracketing the blocks each one spans, one matched `constructStart`/`constructEnd` pair per construct, nesting as brackets do; in the tree they are promoted to a group over exactly that region, carrying the same descriptor. Both docx writers write them back.

A construct whose extent is a sub-sequence of one paragraph's runs — a field inside a sentence, a bookmark over three words, a few inserted words in an otherwise untouched paragraph — has no marker encoding: the marker pair brackets whole blocks, so those occurrences keep their existing treatment (the text still comes through; the construct itself does not). See the gotchas below.

### Migrating from 3.x

The `DocumentPackage` readers and writers took the primary names, and the functions that held them were renamed rather than removed. Every one of them still behaves exactly as it did:

| Was | Is now |
| --- | --- |
| `readDocx` | `readDocxContent` |
| `readPptx` | `readPptxContent` |
| `readXlsx` | `readXlsxWorkbook` |
| `buildDocxPackage` | `buildDocxPackageFromContent` |
| `buildXlsxPackage` | `buildXlsxPackageFromContent` |

`readXlsxContent` is unchanged, and is the one name that already followed this convention.

Three of the renames are silent under a plain call — `readDocx`, `readPptx`, and `readXlsx` still take a `Package`, they just return a `DocumentPackage` now — so a TypeScript caller sees the break where it uses the result (`doc.sections` becomes `document.children`), and a JavaScript caller sees it at runtime. Either add the `Content` suffix to keep the previous behaviour, or move to the tree.

### Deep imports

Every module under `src/` is importable directly, by the same path it has relative to `src/`, without going through the barrel:

```ts
import { bytesToBase64, base64ToBytes } from 'ooxml.js/util/base64';
import { readXlsxContent } from 'ooxml.js/typed/xlsx/content';
import { readDocx, buildDocxPackage } from 'ooxml.js/typed/document-package';
```

## The ooxml.js format

**The ooxml.js format** is a compact, still-plain-JSON alternative to the verbose `Package` (which repeats `type`/`tag`/`attributes`/`children` keys per node, with tag/namespace strings recurring thousands of times) — tuple-encoded nodes plus one interned string table, composing on `packageCodec`:

```
OOXML bytes --[packageCodec]--> Package --[compactCodec]--> CompactPackage (the ooxml.js format)
```

```ts
import { decodePackage, toCompact, fromCompact } from 'ooxml.js';

const pkg = decodePackage(bytes);
const compact = toCompact(pkg); // { s: string[], p: Record<path, CompactPart> }
const roundTripped = fromCompact(compact); // deep-equals pkg
```

A `word/document.xml` part holding a single run of text:

```xml
<w:p><w:r><w:t>Hi</w:t></w:r></w:p>
```

decodes to this `Package` (one entry in `parts`, each element an `XmlNode`):

```json
{
  "parts": {
    "word/document.xml": {
      "kind": "xml",
      "nodes": [
        {
          "type": "element",
          "tag": "w:p",
          "attributes": [],
          "children": [
            {
              "type": "element",
              "tag": "w:r",
              "attributes": [],
              "children": [
                {
                  "type": "element",
                  "tag": "w:t",
                  "attributes": [],
                  "children": [{ "type": "text", "value": "Hi" }]
                }
              ]
            }
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

`toCompact` interns every tag and text value once (first-occurrence order) and replaces each node with a tuple (type code `0`=element/`1`=text, then string-table indices):

```json
{
  "s": ["w:p", "w:r", "w:t", "Hi"],
  "p": {
    "word/document.xml": [[0, 0, [], [[0, 1, [], [[0, 2, [], [[1, 3]]]]]]]]
  }
}
```

Reading the outer tuple: `[0, 0, [], [...]]` is an element whose tag is `s[0]` (`"w:p"`), wrapping a child recursing down to the text leaf `[1, 3]` (`s[3]` = `"Hi"`). It is a JSON shape, not a compression layer: every string stays human-readable, so it stays diffable and debuggable. `fromCompact(toCompact(pkg))` round-trips exactly; `toCompact` is deterministic.

All three format pairs have a direct codec — `packageCodec` (bytes ⇄ `Package`), `compactCodec` (`Package` ⇄ `CompactPackage`), and `compactPackageCodec` (bytes ⇄ `CompactPackage` directly):

```ts
import { decodeCompactPackage, encodeCompactPackage } from 'ooxml.js';

const compact = decodeCompactPackage(bytes); // OOXML bytes -> CompactPackage directly
const out = encodeCompactPackage(compact); // CompactPackage -> OOXML bytes directly
```

## Build, test, and lint

```sh
pnpm build          # turbo run _build (tsdown -> dist/: one ESM + CJS + .d.ts set per source module, via tsdown.config.ts)
pnpm lint           # turbo run _lint (eslint . --fix --cache --max-warnings 0)
pnpm typecheck      # turbo run _typecheck _typecheck:node (tsc against tsconfig.json + tsconfig.node.json, the dual-tsconfig setup)
pnpm test           # turbo run _test (vitest run --project unit)
pnpm test:watch     # vitest --project unit
pnpm test:workers   # turbo run _test:workers (vitest run --config vitest.workers.config.ts)
pnpm test:smoke     # turbo run _test:smoke (builds dist/, then runs test/smoke.test.mjs to verify the built ESM and CJS artifacts both load and behave identically)
```

`pnpm prepublishOnly` runs `lint`, `typecheck`, `tsdown`, `publint`, and `attw --pack`. `test/smoke.test.mjs` loads the built ESM/CJS barrels and checks they behave identically — a check `tsc`/`publint`/`attw` cannot do.

`tsdown.config.ts`'s `entry` is a `src/**/*.ts` glob (excluding tests/`.d.ts`), so `dist/` mirrors `src/` one ESM/CJS/.d.ts/.d.cts set per module; `package.json`'s `exports` adds a `"./*"` wildcard for deep imports.

To run a single test file: `pnpm vitest run src/typed/docx.test.ts`.

## Architecture

The package layers a lossless core outward to lossy convenience views:

- **`src/model/`** — schemas: `node.ts` (`XmlNode`: `text`/`cdata`/`comment`/`declaration`/`pi`/`element`, an ordered forest matching XML mixed content) and `package.ts` (`Package`: path → `Part`; `xml` parts hold parsed nodes, `binary` parts hold base64 bytes — keeping `Package` plain JSON).
- **`src/xml/`** — `parse.ts`/`build.ts` convert XML strings ⇄ `XmlNode[]` via `fast-xml-parser` (`preserveOrder`, entity re-encoding disabled, so order, mixed content, and entity encoding survive).
- **`src/zip.ts`** — thin `fflate` wrapper (`zipSync`/`unzipSync`).
- **`src/package-io/`** — `read.ts`/`write.ts` unzip, classify each entry as XML or binary (`looksLikeXml` byte sniff), and parse/serialize.
- **`src/codec.ts`** — public round-trip surface: `packageCodec`/`xmlCodec` (`z.codec()` pairs) plus `decodePackage`/`encodePackage` wrappers.
- **`src/compact.ts`** — the ooxml.js format: `compactCodec`/`compactPackageCodec` plus `toCompact`/`fromCompact`/`decodeCompactPackage`/`encodeCompactPackage` wrappers.
- **`src/typed/`** — lossy projections. `readDocxContent` resolves the full style cascade (`docDefaults` → `basedOn` → paragraph-mark → character styles → direct formatting) into ordered `sections` plus comments/footnotes/headers/footers/numbering; `readPptxContent` resolves placeholder → layout → master → theme inheritance into `slides` (presentation order via `p:sldIdLst`); `readXlsxWorkbook` covers cell values/formulas, merged ranges, defined names. `typed/shared/` holds shared OOXML primitives (`drawingml.ts` geometry/theme/colour, `color.ts` `ColorTransform` cascade, `units.ts`, `metadata.ts`, `source-path.ts`). Types come from `document-schema.js`. Only the docx and xlsx `ContentDocument`-shaped pairs encode back to a `Package`; everything else is one-way, and faithful round-tripping goes through `decodePackage`/`encodePackage`.
- **`src/typed/document-package.ts`** — the `DocumentPackage`-native surface, and nothing else: `readDocx`/`readPptx`/`readXlsx` are their content-level reader composed with `document-schema.js`'s `assemblePackage`, `buildDocxPackage`/`buildXlsxPackage` are `flattenPackage` composed with their content-level writer. One module rather than one per format, because the adapters are format-uniform and the reasoning behind them (why a reader mints styles rather than calling bare `decompose`, why a writer's kind guard lives at this boundary, what a docx's non-content parts do instead of riding the tree) is one argument stated once.
- **`src/typed/docx/`** — `read.ts` and `write.ts` are a read/write pair over `ContentSection[]`. `constructs.ts` owns the fidelity construct vocabulary both halves share: the descriptor shapes (`contentControl` from `w:sdt`, `field` from `w:fldChar`/`w:fldSimple`, `anchor` from `w:bookmarkStart`/`End`, `provenance` from `w:ins`/`w:del`/`w:moveFrom`/`w:moveTo`) and the rule deciding which occurrences are block-scoped enough to bracket. `buildDocxPackageFromContent` builds a complete docx `Package` from scratch; it writes no `styles.xml`, `numbering.xml`, comments, footnotes, or headers/footers, so the `DocxDocument` fields outside `sections` do not survive the pair.
- **`src/typed/xlsx/`** — a `ContentDocument`-shaped read/write pair alongside the lossy `readXlsxWorkbook` (both exported; different callers). `readXlsxContent` reads column widths, row heights, hidden rows/columns, merged ranges, every cell value kind, print settings, and cell comments (`comments.ts`: legacy `xl/comments{N}.xml` notes plus `[MS-XLSX]` threaded comments, both resolved through the worksheet part's own relationships, never by part name); `buildXlsxPackageFromContent` builds a complete xlsx `Package` from scratch (never editing the decoded package). `number-format.ts`/`styles.ts`/`serial.ts` run both ways: reading classifies style index → format code → kind (`percentage`/`currency`/`date`/`time`/`dateTime`); writing emits interned `numFmt` codes, fed back through the classifier in tests. The classifier is not a formatter (`displayText` is the typed-value spelling). Scope limits: `currency` with no ISO code writes as plain `number`; non-canonical temporal values degrade to text; cell comments read but do not write (`buildXlsxPackageFromContent` emits no comment part, so they do not survive this pair); column widths re-approximate through xlsx's own character-width unit on every write, so a width drifts slightly on each round trip rather than reaching a fixed point.

## Conventions

- **Zod-first schema/type/guard.** Every model type is inferred from its Zod schema (`z.infer<typeof XSchema>`), not hand-written.
- **`XmlNode` uses a recursive structural guard, not `z.lazy`.** `z.lazy` collapses to `unknown` for element-children in the pinned Zod version, so `XmlElementSchema` validates `children` via `z.custom<XmlNode>(isXmlNode)`. Any change to `XmlNode`'s shape must update `isXmlNode` in step. `CompactXmlNode` and `document-schema.js`'s `ContentBlock` reuse this pattern.
- **Lossless core vs. lossy views is a hard boundary.** `decodePackage`/`encodePackage` stay byte/part faithful. A `src/typed/*` reader is a lossy projection; faithful round-tripping goes through the generic `Package`. `readXlsxContent`/`buildXlsxPackageFromContent` and `readDocxContent`/`buildDocxPackageFromContent` are the deliberate exceptions — read/write pairs around the shared content model, where each writer builds a fresh package rather than touching the decoded one. The `DocumentPackage`-native pairs above them are those same pairs with a structural transform on each end, so they inherit exactly the same boundary.
- **XML entities stay raw in the lossless layer.** `parseXml` runs with `processEntities: false`; typed readers decode the five standard entities (`decodeEntities` in `typed/util.ts`) only in their own lossy projection.
- **No type assertions.** `eslint.config.ts` bans `as` and angle-bracket casts (`assertionStyle: "never"`, `noInlineConfig: true` — no `eslint-disable` escape hatch). Narrow with a guard or parse with Zod.

## Gotchas and quirks

- **A `Content` suffix means the flat form, not a lesser one.** `readDocx` and `readDocxContent` are the same read; the suffix says which shape comes back (`DocumentPackage` versus the flat `DocxDocument`/`ContentDocument`), never which is more faithful. The pair that genuinely differs in what it reads is `readXlsxWorkbook`, whose name says so by naming its own return type rather than taking a suffix.
- **A construct marker brackets whole blocks, never a sub-sequence of runs.** `document-schema.js`'s flat form has no run-level extent, so an inline field, a mid-paragraph bookmark, a run-level content control, or a few inserted words inside an otherwise untouched paragraph are read exactly as before — the text survives, the construct does not. So does an extent that crosses another, or that straddles a section break: neither is expressible as balanced brackets, and both are dropped rather than emitted at a position that would decode to a different nesting.
- **The docx pair round-trips `sections`, not a whole `DocxDocument`.** Numbering definitions, cell border styling/shading, and `w:themeColor` (without `themeShade`/`themeTint`) are read; images read into `ContentImageBlock` (floating `wp:anchor` position not recorded); `PAGE`/`NUMPAGES` fields resolve to Word's cached text. The writer emits no `styles.xml`, `numbering.xml`, comments, footnotes, or headers/footers, so the `DocxDocument` fields outside `sections` do not come back — a paragraph's `styleId` is still written as a `w:pStyle` reference, resolving to nothing, since every property the style would have contributed is already spelled as direct formatting by then.
- **pptx is read-only.** Connector shapes (`p:cxnSp`) are skipped; shape rotation composes through groups; a chart graphic frame reads its chart part's cached series/category model into a table block (header row = series names, one row per category index); a SmartArt graphic frame reads its diagram data model's node text as paragraphs in diagram order (depth-first over `parOf` connections, siblings by `srcOrd`); an OLE graphic frame reads the fallback picture its `mc:Fallback` carries (or, with none reachable, a paragraph naming the `p:oleObj`'s `progId`) — the embedded payload itself is an external application's data and is not decoded.
- **xlsx has no native percentage/currency/date/time cell type.** Both directions are closed via the number-format engine: reading classifies style → format code → kind; writing emits interned `numFmt` codes, fed back through the classifier in tests. `displayText` is the typed-value spelling, not the producer's rendered string.
- **`test:smoke` depends on a fresh build.** It runs `tsdown && vitest run --project smoke`, always rebuilding `dist/` first. A bare `vitest` runs both projects; `smoke` fails loudly (`Cannot find module '../dist/index.js'`) if `dist/` is unbuilt.
- **Binary-vs-XML part classification is a byte sniff, not an extension check.** `looksLikeXml` looks for a leading `<` after skipping a UTF-8 BOM and whitespace; any future binary format starting with `<` would misclassify.
- **`Array.isArray` narrows `unknown` to `any[]`, not `unknown[]`.** Indexing the result reintroduces `any` and trips `no-unsafe-assignment`. `compact.ts` and `xml/parse.ts` each define a local `isUnknownArray` guard (`value is unknown[]`) — use it wherever the narrowed element is read.
- **TypeScript is pinned to the latest 6.x, not 7.** TS 7 breaks `typescript-eslint` (peer range `<6.1.0`) and `cosmiconfig`'s TS loader (via `typescript.findConfigFile`, which TS 7 no longer exports). Wait for ecosystem support.
- **`release-notes-generator`'s `preset` is `angular`, not `conventionalcommits` (unlike `commit-analyzer`).** `conventional-changelog-conventionalcommits@10.x` exports its body under `template`, but the bundled `conventional-changelog-writer` reads only `options.mainTemplate`, so the body falls back to a generic default — producing an empty changelog. Don't switch without checking upstream.

## Fidelity

Conversion is **part-content-faithful**: every XML part re-serialises to equivalent XML, every binary part to identical bytes, no parts dropped or added. The re-zipped file opens correctly in Word, Excel, and PowerPoint. It is **not** byte-for-byte identical at the ZIP-container level — re-zipping changes archive entry layout (order, compression, metadata), not achievable deterministically across tools.

## Release and publishing

`.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs commitlint, lint, typecheck, unit, and smoke on every push/PR. On push to `main`, `release.config.ts` drives [semantic-release](https://semantic-release.gitbook.io/semantic-release): commit history decides the bump, `CHANGELOG.md`/`package.json` commit back to `main`, a GitHub Release is cut, and the package publishes to [npmjs.org](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ooxml.js) via OIDC trusted publishing (no `NPM_TOKEN`).

Release success is detected by diffing `package.json`'s version before/after. Two further jobs gate on that: one republishes under `@exadev/ooxml.js` to GitHub Packages (via `GITHUB_TOKEN`), and one packs the release, generates an SPDX SBOM (`pnpm sbom`), and signs an SBOM and a build-provenance attestation — verifiable independently of the registry, and present even if the package is later unpublished.

## Contributing

Commits follow Conventional Commits (`feat:`, `fix:`, `test:`, `chore:`, …), enforced by commitlint (`commitlint.config.ts`) via a husky `commit-msg` hook and a CI job — semantic-release's version bump depends on these being well-formed. A husky `pre-commit` runs `lint-staged` (`eslint --fix` on staged `*.ts`); `pre-push` runs the test suite. Single `main` branch; no open PR workflow established.
