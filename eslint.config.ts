    // `project` (global -- no `files` filter) powers the type-checked rules below; it must apply to every matched file or the type-checked configs crash on files outside the program. Two TSConfig programs are listed: tsconfig.json is the runtime-src web-only gate (lib ES2024+WebWorker, types [], no @types/node -- the isomorphism check), and tsconfig.node.json (lib ES2024, @types/node) covers test files, test-support, eslint-rules, and the root config files. `project` (not `projectService`) is required here: the TS project service auto-discovers only tsconfig.json by name and cannot route the nested test files that live solely in tsconfig.node.json (its `allowDefaultProject` deliberately blocks `**` globs), whereas listing both tsconfigs lets each file resolve to the program that includes it -- runtime src to the web program, tests/config/eslint-rules to the node program.
