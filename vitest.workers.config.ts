// Runs the test/workers suite under the real Cloudflare Workers runtime (workerd) via @cloudflare/vitest-pool-workers' cloudflareTest plugin (the current vitest-4 API -- a plugin, not the older defineWorkersProject/config helper). ooxml.js's decode path (unzipPackage/zipPackage/decodePackage/readXlsxContent, backed by fflate) is designed to carry zero Node-API usage; this config turns that design property into a runtime-checked fact rather than an assertion -- if any primitive (or its fflate/fast-xml-parser dependency) touched a Node-only API, the workerd isolate would throw instead of the test passing. Kept in a separate config from the default node `vitest run --project unit` so the existing node suite is unchanged; run explicitly via `pnpm test:workers`.
export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [cloudflareTest({ wrangler: { configPath: './wrangler.jsonc' } })],
